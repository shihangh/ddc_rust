# An Introduction to Dynamic Discrete Choice Models | Estimating the Rust (1987) Bus Engine Replacement Model
This repository provides [Matlab code](https://github.com/shihangh/ddc_rust/tree/main/code) to estimate the Rust (1987) Bus Engine Replacement Model.
It also contains [slides](https://github.com/shihangh/ddc_rust/blob/97373a73f866c1743aa35848cb3be8c4500b196a/deck/rust_presentation.pdf) that provide a very brief overview of dynamic discrete choice models and walk through the model and code.
